WARNING: THIS IS LIVE ON THE WEBSITE/APP
DO NOT MAKE EDITS THAT YOU DO NOT DESIRE TO APPEAR FOR USERS
MAKE SURE TO SAVE AND KEEP COPIES

How to use:

Every line is "read" by the program
However, the program only considers lines beginning with "<" as code
	Lines beginning with an indent (tab) or space will NOT be read
The lines beginning with "<" will be considered as code from the ">" until the "/"
	Everything between "<" and ">" is a note for editing, NOT considered as code
		This is useful for identifying what you are editing
	Everything after the "/" is a note for editing, NOT considered as code
Blank lines are skipped over by the program, only here to help editors

Example:

	<NOTES_go_in_here> DISPLAYED TEXT goes in here / more NOTES go in here
	This line is all notes
	<NOTES> DISPLAYED TEXT / NOTES


This is how some courses would look (do NOT include the indent if you want the program to read it):

NOTE - 	The items (course_id, course_name, creditc, etc) MUST be in this order
	Do NOT add more items to the list (Don't add a "<average_grade>" category)
		This WILL cause the program to make mistakes

	<course_id> X1849703 / 		This ID number should match the official course ID number
	<course_name> Precalculus / 	Use the most official name
	<credits> 1.0 / 		This MUST fit in 0.0 format (1.0 or 0.5) DO NOT use 1, .5 or 1/2
	<weight> False / 		Only use "True" or "False", True would be for weighted (AP) classes
	<grade_division> L /		Determines if lowers (L) or uppers (U) will likely take the class. UX means that ONLY uppers can take it, LX is ONLY lowers
	<teacher_name> Ting Sheppy /	Be formal here
	<prerequisites> Algebra 2 /	ONLY use the HIGHEST prerequisite (Algebra 2, NOT Algebra 1 or Geometry)
